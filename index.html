          <h4>Cheaper</h4>
          <p>A 12oz latte costs -on average- $4.00. &nbsp;
            However, ~$17 nets a 1 lbs bag of whole bean, speciality coffee. &nbsp; 
            That comes out to ~23 cups of coffee/bag, or ~$0.75/cup. &nbsp; 
            It's even cheaper when buying commercial coffee in bulk. &nbsp; 
            Coffee is a commodity. &nbsp; 
            It's cheap. &nbsp; 
            Coffee being expensive at a cafe is a result of other accrued costs.

          <h4>Faster</h4>
          <p>
            On average it takes a 10 minute round trip for me to get to a cafe from my house.&nbsp;
            Factor in ~5 minutes in line, and ~5 minutes until I get my drink, and I've spent 20 minutes getting coffee. &nbsp;
            At home I can brew coffee in less than 5 minutes, saving time and money.

          <h4>Soothing</h4>
          <p>
            Something about the routine of brewing is satsfying and calming. &nbsp;
            The more routine I incorporate into my morning, the more prepared I feel for my day. &nbsp;
            Brewing is a simple task that I do everyday that centers me like a shower.

        <p>
          As soon as you grind coffee, you break apart the cells, exposing more surface area to air. &nbsp;
          This rapidly increases the oxidation rate of the coffee. &nbsp;
          After some time the coffee becomes stale, flat. &nbsp;
          Coffee is a fresh food, and sometimes we forget that. &nbsp;
          If possible, pick up a coffee grinder.&nbsp;
          A blade grinder can cost as low as $15, while a high quality domestic burr grinder averages $100.&nbsp;
          How much you invest into your experience is up to you.

        <p>Buy fair trade locally roasted coffee! For ethical and flavor reasons!</p>

        <h4>Water</h4>
        <figure><img src="IMAGES/filter.jpeg"></figure>
        <p>
          Using filtered water ensures that you aren't contaminating your brew with minerals that can negatively impact flavor.&nbsp;
          This is one of the secrets that cafes use to make better drip than you do at home.

        <h4>Additives</h4>

        <p>
          Cream, sugar, etc.&nbsp;
          If you have a good brewing set-up, often you don't need it -taste wise-.&nbsp;
          If you are sensitive to acidic foods, then milk or cream is definitely something you should add to your coffee.&nbsp;
          The basic dairy helps balance your tummy. &nbsp;
          I will recommend buying smaller quantities of milk/cream to ensure freshness at all times.&nbsp;
          If you don't like bitter things, adding sugar -or a sugar substitute- is not shameful.&nbsp;
          However, if your brew is unbearably bitter, you are probably doing something wrong. &nbsp;
          Pay attention to the recipes!
